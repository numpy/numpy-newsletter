title: "Making Numpy accessible"
---

Numpy is now foundational to Python scientific computing. Our efforts reach millions of developers each month. 
As our user base grows, so does the number of users with disabilities. In the open-source ecosystem, accessibility 
is often considered low-priority, scary, or someone else’s job. Read the blog post by Mars Lee, a front-end developer and designer at Quansight, 
how she along with Melissa Weber Mendonça championed the efforts to support NumPy users with visual impairments 
and make the NumPy website and documentation more accessible: https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2021/07/numpy-accessibility-guidelines/.
