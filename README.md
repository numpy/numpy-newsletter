**NUMPY NEWSLETTER**

**Objectives**
Inform, educate, and inspire the NumPy community.


**Subscriber acquisition channels:**
- a sign up form in the footer of numpy.org,
- Twitter announcements.

**Frequency**
<br>Issues will be numbered (e.g. Issue No. 24):
- appropriate for a project that has “numerical” in its name,
- will allow the editorial team to have some flexibility with the frequency of releases.


**Design**
<br>A custom template is preferred. 
<br>Options:
- MailChimp (detailed reports, up to 2000 subscribers on a free plan),
- Send in Blue (unlimited contacts).


**Content outline**
- latest most important news (events, funding received, etc.);
- contributor spotlight (could be contractors as well as volunteers);
- explain a NumPy feature, either new or cool-but-not-well-known;
- highlight an upcoming significant improvement (could be a code feature, update on the website, etc.).

Segment headings are needed.
 
 
**Interview Questionnaire**
<br>A questionnaire will be used to profile featured NumPy contributors.
